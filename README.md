# Java++
Java++ is a personal project. I called it Java++, because I (obviously) like Java and I also like the reason why C++ is called C++ but actually if I think again, maybe I should have named it Java--. Once I have a good day, will rename the project. //TODO: rename project

You can see some examples in the Examples folder

## Rules
- Space between Operations
- New line for each instruduction
- For calling a function: no space before '(' and no space between attributes
- A String has to be in one line
- Comments have to be in a line without an instruction. Use '//' to mark a line as comment


## Compile
- Clone the repo
- Build the jar with maven
- Write some Java++ code
- Save the file as .jpp
- Run the jar with needed options in console
- (Hopefully) the program runs 


## Bugs
If you found bugs / unexpected features then please let me know or fix them by yourself (I like github).
